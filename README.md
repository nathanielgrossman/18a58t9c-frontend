## Description
This is the frontend for an ongoing photographic journal. The default view displays a selection of images chosen by an algorithim (considering factors such as when the image was last viewed, how many times it's been viewed, how recently it was uploaded) scattered across the page. There is also a sequential view that displays images in a timeline based on date of upload.
